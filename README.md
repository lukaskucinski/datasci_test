#Test1
"Inner breathlessness, outer restlessness
By the time I caught up to freedom I was out of breath."
#Test2
"Grandma asked me what I'm running from, 
I guess I'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for, 
What mother's birth their youngin's for
And some say Jesus coming for"
#Test 3
"For all I know the earth is spinning slow
Sun's at half-mast cuz masses ain't aglow
On bended kneww, prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me"
